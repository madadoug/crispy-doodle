    <h1><strong>Who is Madalyn Douglass?</strong></h1>
    <hr>
    <p> I am a studio arts major with a focus in graphic design at Southern Illinois University Edwardsville. 
         Last summer of 2018, I began the learning track at LaunchCode for UX design and graduated from the
        course that December. With that said, I am continuing my education through LaunchCode's web development 
        course so that I have a better understanding of how my designs can be interpreted to the developers I will 
        be working with. Because I am a senior in college, I really do not have a professional journey related to tech; however,
        I feel LaunchCode is preparing me to speak to entry level roles for after I graduate this semester.
